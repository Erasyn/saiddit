#For the form to delete a post

Input parameters: sub, title, creator

First you have to run this select query and save the result.
It will be the argument in the subsaiddit spot (because we have to use id).

SELECT id FROM subsaiddits WHERE title = "sub_title"

then run this one with the sub_id (Note that sub_id is an integer)

DELETE FROM posts WHERE
subsaiddit = "sub" AND
title = "title" AND
creator = "creator"




#For the form to create a post

Input parameters: sub, title, creator, text, url(make null by default) 

Same procedure here as above


SELECT id FROM subsaiddits WHERE title = "sub_title"

INSERT INTO posts (subsaiddit, title, creator, text, url)
VALUES (sub, "title", "creator", "text", "url")
